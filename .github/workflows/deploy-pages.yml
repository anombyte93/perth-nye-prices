# GitHub Actions workflow for deploying to GitHub Pages
# Copy this file to your project: .github/workflows/deploy-pages.yml
#
# This workflow:
# 1. Triggers on push to main OR manual dispatch
# 2. Builds your static site (if needed)
# 3. Deploys to GitHub Pages using OIDC authentication
#
# Usage:
#   - For simple static sites (HTML/CSS/JS): Just push, it deploys
#   - For build-required sites: Uncomment the build steps
